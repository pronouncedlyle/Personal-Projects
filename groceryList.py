#To Do: 
#1  Create dictionary with a few examples *DONE*
#2. Create function to show the grocery list
#3. Create function to let user add meals with their ingredients to the list
#4. Figure out how to add correct quantities into the list
#5. Figure out how to add servings sizes into calculations when generating list. Q: how many people are eating?
#Later:
#Create a UI (in JS if it's a web app, something else if it's a android app?)
# Custom input: add items not part of your meal. 
#compare needed items to items already "in stock" (based on a fictional list, like froma smart fridge or something)
#create a web scraper to pull recipes from the internet and automatically input needed ingredients (way later)
